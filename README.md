# Basic HTML and CSS 
 This Repository Showcases All the Challenge and Projects that Have Completed While I Taking a Foundational HTML and CSS Course "Modern HTML & CSS from the Beginning (Including Sass)" on UDEMY by Brad Traversy.  It Chronicles My Journey as I Developed the Foundational Skills Required to Design and Style Websites from the Ground Up.

# About This Repo
 Throughout the course, I completed hands-on challenges and built functional mini-projects that strengthened my front-end skills step by step.

 This repository showcases my progress and highlights the practical experience I gained while turning concepts into real, responsive webpages.
